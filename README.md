# JUnit 5 Sandpit
A sandpit project to try out the new JUnit 5 features. The examples are themed around Star Trek the Next Generation but no in depth science fiction knowledge is required.

This project contains 2 modules:
* junit4and5 contains a sample project which runs both a junit 4 and a junit 5 test classes.
* junit5only contains a sample project with only junit 5 test classes and provides examples of different capabilities.

To run the build run `gradle build` which will run both modules and all the tests.

These examples are discussed in detail in the following [blog post](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/10/10/junit-5.html).
